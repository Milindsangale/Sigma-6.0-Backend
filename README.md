# 🔧 Node.js
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side to build scalable and high-performance applications. In this repository, Node.js serves as the backend runtime environment for handling HTTP requests, business logic, and integration with databases.

# 🗃️ SQL
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and querying relational databases. The repository includes examples that demonstrate how to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL with databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

# 🌐 REST (Representational State Transfer)
- REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. The repository follows RESTful principles for structuring APIs, using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This ensures a clear, scalable, and maintainable backend.

# 🍃 MongoDB
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. It stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON. In this repository, MongoDB is used to handle unstructured data and integrate seamlessly with Node.js using Mongoose or the native MongoDB driver.

# 📡 REST API
- A REST API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate over the web using HTTP. This repository demonstrates how to build REST APIs using Node.js and Express, with both SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases as the data sources.
